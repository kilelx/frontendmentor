# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).
This is my second submission for this challenge : I tried to improve the JS, I use SCSS now, add few animations, and use semantic HTML.
